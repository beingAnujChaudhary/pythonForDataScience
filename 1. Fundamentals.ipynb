Items can be of different types.\n","      * Example: `[1, 'apple', True, 3.14, [10, 20]]`\n","  * **Tuple Literals (`(...)`)**: Define an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequence of items. Items can be of different types. Parentheses are sometimes optional if the context is clear (e.g., `a = 1, 2, 3` creates a tuple), but it's good practice to use them. An empty tuple is `()`, and a tuple with one item needs a trailing comma: `(1,)`.\n","      * Example: `(1, 'apple', True, 3.14)`\n","  * **Dictionary Literals (`{key: value, ...}`)**: Define an unordered (in Python versions before 3.7; ordered in 3.7+) collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples containing only immutables). Values can be of any type. Dictionaries are mutable. An empty dictionary is `{}`.\n","      * Example: `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': False}`\n","  * **Set Literals (`{item1, item2, ...}`)**: Define an unordered collection of unique, immutable items. Sets are mutable (you can add or remove elements). To create an empty set, you must use `set()`, because `{}` creates an empty dictionary.\n","      * Example: `{1, 'apple', True, 3.14}` (Note: `True` will be treated as `1` here if `1` is also present, as sets store unique values and `True == 1`). If you had `{1, True, 2}`, the set would effectively be `{1, 2}` or `{True, 2}` depending on internal hashing and order of insertion, because `1` and `True` are considered equal in value and hash for set purposes.
