<!-- ## üîß Getting Started: Installation

Follow these steps to get your environment set up:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/beingAnujChaudhary/pythonForDataScience.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/beingAnujChaudhary/pythonForDataScience.git)
    cd pythonForDataScience
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file lists all the necessary Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
